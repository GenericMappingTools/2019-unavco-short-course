	# The module name "coupe" comes from the French verb "to cut". The best translation is a (vertical) cross section.
	# coupe uses the same input file format and same -S options as meca.
	# The cross-section is selected by specifly the locations (longitude and latitude) of a starting point (113/33), 
	# and a ending point (117/33). The cross-section plane is vertical (dip angle=90), with the width set to be 100 km,
	# and depth to be 0-30 km.
	# The plot region (usually set by -R) is automatically determined and set if +f is used.
	#
	# To reverse the Y axis, set the figure heigth to a negative value (-10 cm)
