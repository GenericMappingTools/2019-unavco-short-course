Please follow these instructions to install **GMT 6.0.0rc2** (rc = release candidate)
and other software that will be used. Here is a summary of what you'll need:

* GMT 6.0.0rc2 and its dependencies
* [Ghostscript](https://ghostscript.com/): Used by GMT to convert postscript (GMT's
  native graphics format) into PNG, PDF, etc.
* [GDAL](https://gdal.org/): Library used by GMT for reading and writing raster and
  vector geospatial data formats (pre-installed on Windows).
* [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/): Video creating and conversion software used to make GMT
  animations.
* A text editor of your choice (see [instructions below](#install-a-text-editor)).

**We will use features of GMT that are being introduced in GMT 6.** Showing up to the
workshop with a GMT 5 installation could result in delays for you or not being able to
fully participate in the tasks we have planned for the short course!

See specific instructions for your operating system below:

* [Linux](#linux)
* [Mac](#mac)
* [Windows](#windows)


## Need help?

If have any trouble installing, there are a few you ways to ask for help:

* Open an *Issue* on this repository by
  [clicking here](https://github.com/GenericMappingTools/2019-unavco-course/issues/new/choose).
  You'll need a GitHub account to do this.
* Post to our [Gitter chatroom](https://gitter.im/GenericMappingTools/2019-unavco-course)

Key things you need to tell us so that we can help you:

1. Your operating system
2. The commands you ran or things you installed
3. Which step is giving you trouble
4. What is the exact error message (copy and paste it)


## Linux

There are 2 options for installing GMT 6.0.0rc2:

1. Use the [conda package manager](https://conda.io/en/latest/) to install
   binaries for GMT and all dependencies (**recommended**)
2. Build GMT from source and install dependencies from your system package manager (see
   [instructions below](#building-gmt-from-source))

Unfortunately, you cannot use your system package manager to install GMT because this
course requires GMT 6, which is not available on most distributions.

Most Linux distributions come with a text editor installed. You may also
[install Visual Studio Code](#install-a-text-editor) if you want but it is not required.

### Installing with conda

1. Download and install the [Python **3.7** **64-bit** version of Miniconda](https://conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).
   This will give you access to the conda package manager. **Make sure you select to
   have conda added to your `PATH` when asked by the installer**. If you have
   the Anaconda Python distribution installed, you won't need to do this step.
2. Install GMT 6.0.0rc2 and its dependencies (including ghostscript and gdal) by running
   the following in a terminal:

   ```
   conda install gmt=6.0.0rc2 -c conda-forge/label/dev -c conda-forge
   ```

3. Install ffmpeg using conda by running the following in a terminal:

   ```
   conda install ffmpeg -c conda-forge
   ```


## Mac

There are 3 options for installing GMT 6.0.0rc2 on Mac:

1. Use the GMT bundle installer and install dependencies separately using Homebrew
   (**recommended**)
2. Use the [conda package manager](https://conda.io/en/latest/) to install
   binaries for GMT and all dependencies
   (follow the same [instructions for conda on Linux](#installing-with-conda))
3. Build GMT from source and install dependencies separately (see
   [instructions below](#building-gmt-from-source))

Make sure you also [have a text editor installed](#install-a-text-editor).

### Using the bundle installer and Homebrew

1. Download and install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) (a package manager for Mac that we
   can use to install our dependencies)
2. Download and install the bundle `gmt-6.0.0rc2-darwin-x86_64.dmg` from the
   [GMT 6.0.0rc2 release page](https://github.com/GenericMappingTools/gmt/releases/tag/6.0.0rc2)
3. Install Ghostscript, GDAL, and ffmpeg by running the following in a terminal (open
   the "Terminal" app, type this in, and hit *Enter*):

   ```
   brew update
   brew install gdal ghostscript ffmpeg
   ```


## Windows

Before installing GMT, you will need access to a UNIX style terminal with a
[bash shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_%28Unix_shell%29) for GMT scripting.
**Don't worry if you don't know what this means. We'll go through it in the first day of
the workshop.**
Linux and Mac usually come with one installed but Windows users aren't so lucky.
To install a terminal with a bash shell on Windows:

1. Download and install Git-for-Windows `Git-2.22.0-64-bit.exe` from
   [their official website](https://gitforwindows.org/).
   There are
   [video instructions for installing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=339AEqk9c-8)
   provided by [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/)
2. In this course, when you see/hear "Terminal" you should open the "Git Bash" program.

To install GMT, we'll use the Windows installer:

1. Download and install Ghostscript `gs926aw64.exe`
   [from the official website](https://github.com/ArtifexSoftware/ghostpdl-downloads/releases/tag/gs926)
2. Download and install the GMT Windows installer `gmt-6.0.0_2019.07.10-win64.exe`
   from [this link](http://w3.ualg.pt/~jluis/mirone/gmt-6.0.0_2019.07.10-win64.exe).
   It comes with GDAL and ffmpeg pre installed.

Make sure you also [have a text editor installed](#install-a-text-editor).


## Building GMT from source

Follow the ["Building from source" instructions](https://github.com/GenericMappingTools/gmt/blob/master/BUILDING.md)
from the GMT repository.


## Install a text editor

You'll need a [text editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_editor) to write GMT
scripts.
Any editor is fine and may use your preferred one.
If you don't have one, we recommend installing the "Stable" version of [Visual Studio
Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) on Linux, Mac, or Windows.
Installers and instructions are available on their website.
